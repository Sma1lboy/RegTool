- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Start with how you used the project, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

#### Guidelines for Pull Requests

- Follow the project coding style.

## Style Guides

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
